# Finding unique PCR primers in viral genomes
This project was for my university course of advanced bioinformatics. The main goal was to create a program to find unique PCR primers in viral genomes.

#Importance of this project
Since the program was going to be used by other researchers, I learned to comment well the program so other people could be able to read. This project was also a milestone since was the first program I made for real use to others.
